# Endless Sky

Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...

------

Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny spaceship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.

See the [player's manual](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual) for more information, or the [home page](https://endless-sky.github.io/) for screenshots and the occasional blog post.

## Contributing

As a free and open source game, Endless Sky is the product of many people's work. Contributions of artwork, storylines, and other writing are most in-demand, though there is a loosely defined [roadmap](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/DevelopmentRoadmap). Those who wish to [contribute](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) are encouraged to review the [wiki](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki), and to post in the [community-run Discord](https://discord.gg/ZeuASSx) beforehand. Those who prefer to use Steam can use its [discussion rooms](https://steamcommunity.com/app/404410/discussions/) as well, or GitHub's [discussion zone](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/discussions).

Endless Sky's main discussion and development area was once [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/endless-sky), but due to factors outside our control, it is now inaccessible to new users, and should not be used anymore.
